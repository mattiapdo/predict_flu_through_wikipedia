## Influenza Forecasting from Wikipedia Page Counts

### Abstract

Infectious disease is a leading threat to public health, economic stability, and many other social structures. 

Efforts to mitigate these impacts depend on accurate and timely monitoring so as the risk and the progress of a disease can be measured. 

Since new techniques based on social internet data, such as social media and search queries are emerging one may think to derive some fruitful results. 

Indeed although such efforts are promising, often important challenges in the areas of scientific review, breadth of diseases and countries, and forecasting may hinder their operational usefulness. 

For this use,focused on estimating the Influenza incidents (which in certain periods are given) we examine an available, open data source, the Italian Wikipedia.

By downloading raw data roughly from 2014 untill 2018 in the context of Influenza, we saved in each .csv file relevant pageview word counts. 

Our **goal** is, via performing a model, to estimate the true pattern of Influenza incidence using current data so as to be in a position to forecast.
